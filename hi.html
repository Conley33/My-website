    <h1> BOOM another picture of my dog, she's cool huh</h1>
    <h2>I haven't mentioned yet that my dog loves toys... almost too much. She'll use anything as a toy, and I mean anything at all.
        It was an issue at one point because she was like a force of nature, kind of like a tornado that ransacked my apartment daily.
        she's gotten a lot better about it but she still likes to rip of paper which.... at the most is inconvenient when cleaining it up.
    </h2>
    <h3>a fun little fact, we got this shirt around fall. it was a fun day for everyone because we went to the store,
         got some watermelon, got a new toy and a bag of treats! Another fun fact her favorite food is watermelon. She loves that stuff</h3>

<footer>I don't have much to put here, which is okay. I could tell you something like her paws smell like fritos but
    I think that's like a global thing for puppies everywhere
