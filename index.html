        <ul class="dog">
            <li>About 8 months after we got her, she decided it'd be a great idea to chew through a wooden shoe rack we
                had</li>
            <li>She also used to have a specific couch cushion where she'd slowly tear out stuffing, and hide it. It was
                great.</li>
            <li>Once she even ran away... but not actually, it was more like she walked away from me slowly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Although it might seem like she's a little hellraiser, she's actually pretty sweet. She just had bad
            seperation anxiety.</p>
